This program appears to show that Apple macOS 10.14 has a non-atomic unlink(2)
syscall; concurrent threads can see the file in a weird state during
unlinking.

On FreeBSD and Linux, the program prints out nothing: the 'reader' thread
either sees the file as not existing, or existing and containing exactly 11
bytes (= the unlink was atomic).

On macOS, it prints out a few messages indicating that it saw an intermediate
state where the file existed but was empty.  Is that a bug?
